 * The phpTiSrc Toolbox is mainly based on the gd library. 
 * Many image processing php library exists. 
 * We chose the gd library mainly because it is usually available in the php default libraries that you get with Xamp, or Mamp.
 *
 * \subsection documentation_phpTiSrc Documentation on phpTiSrcLib
 * You can find the documentation of the phpTiSrc lib in 
 * \code 
 * phpTiSrc/doc/html
 * \endcode
 * \n
 * This documentation was an automatically generated using Doxygen. If you add new features to the lib and  want to regenerate the documentation,
 * please download Doygen (http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/index.html) and run it in the phpTiSrc. \n
 * The existing Doxyfile is already configured to recursively parse the code in the src folder.
 * \code
 * cd phpTiSrc
 * doxygen
 * \endcode
 *
 * \subsection documentation_gd  Documentation on the gd library
 * PHP is not limited to creating just HTML output. 
 * It can also be used to create and manipulate image files in a variety of different image formats, including GIF, PNG, JPEG, WBMP, and XPM. 
 * Even more convenient, PHP can output image streams directly to a browser. 
 * You will need to compile PHP with the GD library of image functions for this to work. 
 * GD and PHP may also require other libraries, depending on which image formats you want to work with.\n
 * \n
 * You can use the image functions in PHP to get the size of JPEG, GIF, PNG, SWF, TIFF and JPEG2000 images.
