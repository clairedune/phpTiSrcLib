Welcome to the SRC Image Library ! 
 
 
1. Introduction 
 
 You will use this few function for the numerisation class (S2) as well 
 as the image processing and the compression class (S3)
 
2. How to install this library ?
 
 * Step 1 : simply copy the folder phpTiSrcLib in your www folder
 * Step 2 : include the file you need in your php header : 
            include('phpTiSrc/src/srcImageLib.php');

3. Where can I fing the documentation ? 
 
 The phpTiSrc Toolbox is mainly based on the gd library. 
 Many image processing php library exists. 
 We chose the gd library mainly because it is usually available in the php default libraries that you get with Xamp, or Mamp.
 
 3.1.  Documentation on phpTiSrcLib
 
	You can find the documentation of the phpTiSrc lib in phpTiSrc/doc/html
	
	This documentation was an automatically generated using Doxygen. 
	If you add new features to the lib and  want to regenerate the documentation,
	please download Doygen (http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/index.html) and run it in the phpTiSrc. 
	The existing Doxyfile is already configured to recursively parse the code in the src folder.
 
 3.2 Documentation on the gd library
   
	PHP is not limited to creating just HTML output. 
	It can also be used to create and manipulate image files in a variety of different image formats, 
	including GIF, PNG, JPEG, WBMP, and XPM. 
	Even more convenient, PHP can output image streams directly to a browser. 
	You will need to compile PHP with the GD library of image functions for this to work. 
	GD and PHP may also require other libraries, depending on which image formats you want to work with.\n
	
	You can use the image functions in PHP to get the size of JPEG, GIF, PNG, SWF, TIFF and JPEG2000 images.
